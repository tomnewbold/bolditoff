#Bolditoff

## Overview
<p>Bolditoff is a self-destructing to-do list application built using Ruby on Rails. Users have seven days to complete a task they have added to their to-do list, before it is deleted automatically. This self-destructing functionality is designed to prioritize items; a user must complete the item within seven days or acknowledge that it is not currently important, keeping the to-do list free of clutter.</p>


## Features
<ul>
<li>Users can create their own account, edit their own profile information and begin their own to-do list.</li>
<li>Each to-do item will display how long the user has left to complete the task.</li>
<li>A user can mark their own items as complete once they have finished it, removing it from the list.</li>
<li>Items older than seven days are automatically removed.</li>
